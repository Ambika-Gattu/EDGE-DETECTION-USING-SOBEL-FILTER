# EDGE-DETECTION-USING-SOBEL-FILTER
This project implements a real-time edge detection system using the Sobel filter, fully developed in Verilog HDL and deployed on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC evaluation board. It enables high-speed image preprocessing with minimal latency through pipelined, parallel architecture and is cross-verified using MATLAB simulations.
